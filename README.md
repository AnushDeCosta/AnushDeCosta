I'm a **data-driven professional** with 10+ years' background in logistics, operations, and creative arts — now channelled into data analytics. I’ve delivered measurable impact through automation, data cleaning, and reporting solutions using **Python, SQL, and Excel**. 

Currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Data Analytics** at the University of South Australia and expanding my knowledge with the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.

I enjoy building tools, visualisations, and stories that turn raw data into business insight.
